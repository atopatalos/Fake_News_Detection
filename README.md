# Fake News Detection
This project focuses on detecting fake news using Machine Learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

# Overview
Fake news detection is an important task in today's digital age where misinformation can spread rapidly. This project aims to build a reliable model that can differentiate between real and fake news articles by leveraging the power of deep learning.

# Project FLow 
The following steps outline the framework used to build the machine learning model for fake news detection:

Problem Understanding and Business Case Analysis
Understand the problem statement, define the goals, and analyze the business case for fake news detection.

Import Libraries and Datasets
Import necessary libraries and load datasets required for building the model. Perform preliminary data processing to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and uncover insights that could help in feature engineering and model building.

Data Cleaning
Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and processing text to remove noise.

Data Visualization
Visualize the dataset using various plots and word clouds to better understand the distribution of words and other features.

Data Preparation
Prepare the data for modeling by performing tokenization (converting text to sequences of tokens) and padding (ensuring all sequences are of the same length).

Model Training using LSTM
Train an LSTM model, a type of RNN well-suited for sequence prediction problems, to learn the patterns associated with fake and real news.

Model Evaluation
Assess and evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it performs well on unseen data.
